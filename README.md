Ground water level prediction - LSTM

This research is on the application of this technology to predict groundwater levels in Jeju Island, South Korea.
The results of this research show that LSTM deep learning technology is able to very accurately predict the groundwater level of a difficult environment like Jeju Island, and it is therefore expected to be very useful in the management and maintenance of Jeju Island's water resources going forward.

To give a simplified summary of the research results, data from January 2009 to June 2020 was used as a foundation to train the LSTM deep learning model, which was then able to predict groundwater levels from July to November 2022; these predictions were then compared to actual observed meteorological data in order to validate the accuracy of the model. 
The RMSE value obtained through this comparison, which measures the predictive power of the model, was confirmed to be 0.2175, demonstrating that the predictions were very accurate.
